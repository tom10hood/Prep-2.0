        <h1> Why I Love Zen Gardening</h1>
        <p>One thing I saw that I liked in the textbook that the web developer did in the Zen garden website was the multiple style sheets, at the bottom of the website, by the link to CSS enlightenment sites. This is done by inserting separate link elements for each style of sheet on the page. This is  in the textbook by emitting the @import rules from the code in a reference to CSS.  </p>

        Zen Gardening was created in the 6th century by Buddhist monks to help them reach deeper levels during medetation. They later used these gardens to help teach the principles and and concepts of Zen. The main parts of a Zen Garden are carefully raked sand or dirt juxtiposed with carefully splaced rocks. Plants can be added to a Zen Garden but they must be minimalist using lowspread plants instead of upright growing plants.

        I created this page to express my love for Zen Gardening. Zen Gardening is something that can decrease stress and increase your quality of life. It changed my life after I got out of prison!
